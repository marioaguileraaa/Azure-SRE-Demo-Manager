# Deployment Changes Summary

## Recent Changes

### February 13, 2026 - Fixed VNet Subnet Management and Deployment Warnings

**Issue:** Infrastructure redeployments were failing with `InUseSubnetCannotBeDeleted` error for the `snet-github-runners` subnet, plus several Bicep warnings (BCP318, no-hardcoded-env-urls).

**Root Cause:** 
1. VNet resource in `hub.bicep` was defining subnets inline in the `subnets` array
2. During redeployment, Azure attempted to reconcile the VNet state and tried to delete subnets not in the inline array
3. The `snet-github-runners` subnet (created by `github-runner-network.bicep`) couldn't be deleted due to its GitHub Actions service association link
4. Conditional resources accessed without null-forgiving operators caused BCP318 warnings
5. Hardcoded `core.windows.net` URL prevented multi-cloud compatibility

**Solution:**
1. **Changed VNet subnet management approach:**
   - Removed inline `subnets` array from VNet resource definition in `hub.bicep`
   - Created all subnets as separate child resources: `snet-vms`, `snet-container-apps`, `snet-app-service`
   - Added proper dependencies between subnets for sequential creation
   - Updated outputs to reference subnet resources directly instead of using array indices
   - This prevents Azure from attempting to delete subnets during redeployment

2. **Fixed BCP318 null-safety warnings:**
   - Added null-forgiving operator `!` for VM resource access in `madrid-api.bicep` outputs
   - Added null-forgiving operator `!` for VM resource access in `paris-api.bicep` outputs
   - Added null-forgiving operator `!` for githubRunners module access in `main.bicep` outputs

3. **Fixed hardcoded environment URL:**
   - Changed from `privatelink.blob.core.windows.net` to `privatelink.blob.${environment().suffixes.storage}` in `storage-private-endpoint.bicep`
   - Now compatible with Azure Government, Azure China, and other sovereign clouds

**Impact:**
- Redeployments now work correctly without subnet deletion conflicts
- All Bicep warnings resolved - clean build with no errors or warnings
- Infrastructure is now multi-cloud compatible
- No changes required to parameters or deployment process
- Fully backward compatible with existing deployments

**Files Modified:**
- `infrastructure/modules/hub.bicep` - VNet subnet management refactoring
- `infrastructure/modules/madrid-api.bicep` - Null-forgiving operators in outputs
- `infrastructure/modules/paris-api.bicep` - Null-forgiving operators in outputs
- `infrastructure/modules/storage-private-endpoint.bicep` - Environment-aware DNS zone name
- `infrastructure/main.bicep` - Null-forgiving operator for githubRunners module output

### February 2026 - Fixed GitHub Runners Subnet Deployment Conflict

**Issue:** Infrastructure redeployments were failing with `InUseSubnetCannotBeDeleted` error for the `snet-github-runners` subnet.

**Root Cause:** The subnet was being created in two places:
1. `hub.bicep` - without GitHub delegation
2. `github-runner-network.bicep` - with proper GitHub delegation

This caused conflicts when redeploying because the subnet had a service association link from GitHub Actions that couldn't be deleted.

**Solution:**
- Removed the duplicate subnet creation from `hub.bicep`
- The subnet is now only created in `github-runner-network.bicep` with proper `GitHub.Network/networkSettings` delegation
- Added `natGatewayId` parameter to `github-runner-network.bicep` for proper outbound connectivity
- Updated `hub.bicep` to output the NAT Gateway ID
- Updated `main.bicep` to pass the NAT Gateway ID to the GitHub runner network module

**Impact:**
- Redeployments now work correctly without manual intervention
- No changes required to parameters or deployment process
- The fix is backward compatible with existing deployments

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to the infrastructure deployment process to:
1. Use the `main.parameters.json` file for deployment configuration
2. Add a private Azure Container Registry (ACR) to the infrastructure

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated deploy.sh Script
The deployment script now uses the `main.parameters.json` file instead of prompting for all parameters interactively.

**Key Changes:**
- Checks for the existence of `main.parameters.json` before proceeding
- Reads location from the parameters file
- Only prompts for the admin password (for security reasons - passwords should not be stored in parameter files)
- Uses `--parameters "@main.parameters.json"` in the Azure CLI deployment commands
- Simplified validation and deployment commands

**Security Note:** The admin password is still required to be entered at runtime and is not stored in the parameters file.

### 2. Added Container Registry Module
Created a new Bicep module: `modules/container-registry.bicep`

**Features:**
- Creates an Azure Container Registry with a unique name
- Supports Basic, Standard, and Premium SKUs
- Admin user enabled by default for easy authentication
- Includes proper outputs for registry name, login server, and URL
- Follows Azure best practices for container registry configuration

### 3. Updated main.bicep
Integrated the Container Registry into the main infrastructure template.

**Changes:**
- Added `createContainerRegistry` parameter (default: true) to optionally create ACR
- Added `containerRegistrySku` parameter to choose the registry tier
- Created a new resource group for the container registry
- Added ACR module deployment with conditional creation
- Added new outputs for container registry information:
  - `containerRegistryName`
  - `containerRegistryLoginServer` 
  - `containerRegistryUrl`

### 4. Updated main.parameters.json
Added new parameters for container registry configuration:

```json
"createContainerRegistry": {
  "value": true
},
"containerRegistrySku": {
  "value": "Basic"
}
```

## How to Use

### Deploying with the New Configuration

1. **Edit the parameters file:**
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure
   nano main.parameters.json
   ```
   
   Update values as needed:
   - `location`: Your preferred Azure region
   - `environment`: dev, test, or prod
   - `adminUsername`: VM administrator username
   - `createContainerRegistry`: Set to `true` to create ACR, `false` to skip
   - `containerRegistrySku`: Choose Basic, Standard, or Premium

2. **Run the deployment:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   
   You will only be prompted for:
   - Admin password (for VMs)
   - Confirmation to proceed

3. **After deployment:**
   The script will output the Container Registry details including:
   - Registry name
   - Login server URL
   - Access credentials

### Using the Container Registry

After deployment, you can:

1. **Login to the registry:**
   ```bash
   az acr login --name <registry-name>
   ```

2. **Get credentials:**
   ```bash
   az acr credential show --name <registry-name>
   ```

3. **Push images:**
   ```bash
   docker tag myimage:latest <registry-name>.azurecr.io/myimage:latest
   docker push <registry-name>.azurecr.io/myimage:latest
   ```

4. **Update Container Apps or VMs to use the private registry:**
   - Use the registry login server URL
   - Configure with admin credentials or managed identity

## Resource Groups Created

The deployment now creates the following resource groups:
- `rg-parking-hub-{environment}` - Networking and Log Analytics
- `rg-parking-frontend-{environment}` - Frontend App Service
- `rg-parking-lisbon-{environment}` - Lisbon Container App
- `rg-parking-madrid-{environment}` - Madrid Windows VM
- `rg-parking-paris-{environment}` - Paris Linux VM
- `rg-parking-registry-{environment}` - **NEW** Azure Container Registry

## Container Registry Naming

The ACR name is automatically generated as:
```
acrparking{environment}{uniqueString}
```

For example: `acrparkingdevxyz123abc`

This ensures global uniqueness as ACR names must be unique across all of Azure.

## Cost Considerations

**Basic SKU:**
- Suitable for development and testing
- 10 GB storage included
- Limited throughput

**Standard SKU:**
- Recommended for production workloads
- 100 GB storage included
- Better performance

**Premium SKU:**
- Advanced features (geo-replication, private link)
- 500 GB storage included
- Best performance

For development environments, Basic SKU is recommended to minimize costs.

## Next Steps

1. Push your container images to the new private registry
2. Update the `lisbonContainerImage` parameter to use images from your private registry
3. Consider configuring managed identity for Container Apps to access the registry without passwords
4. Set up retention policies and security scanning in the Azure Portal

## Rollback

To disable the container registry creation:
1. Edit `main.parameters.json`
2. Set `"createContainerRegistry": { "value": false }`
3. Redeploy

The existing registry will remain but won't be managed by future deployments.
