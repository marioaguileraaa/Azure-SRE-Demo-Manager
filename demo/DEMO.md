# Demo instructions

## Demo agenda (60 min)

- 15 min — What is Azure SRE? What Azure SRE is not.
  - Azure Docs
  - Azure SRE Console
    - Assigned resources
    - Monitor + resource mapping (requires Azure Log Analytics workspace)
    - One SRE per application
  - Settings
  - Daily Reports
  - Builder — Subagent builder to create custom agents
  - Scheduled tasks — Create a task with text and refine with AI

- 5 min — Demo app overview: use cases (Linux, Windows, App Insights, 3rd-party monitoring)

- 20 min — Azure SRE Chat Demo
  - Chat #1 — Generic — Daily Report + follow-up to validate backend APIs with available tools
  - Chat #2 — Alerts — Open alert, check results + create a GitHub issue
  - Chat #3 — App Dependencies — Understand application dependencies via telemetry
  - Chat #4 — Windows Logs (Madrid API)
  - Chat #5 — Linux Logs (Paris API)
  - Chat #6 — 3rd-party API — Assess Berlin API via MCP

## Chat 1 — Generic — Daily Report + backend validation

```prompt
Validate backend APIs for the Parking Manager application using Application Insights over the last 24h. Return a table by dependency target with: calls, failures, success rate (%), avg latency (ms), p95 (ms), max (ms). Highlight top 5 by failures and call out any >2s spikes.
```

## Chat 2 — Alerts — Open alert + create GitHub issue

```prompt
Use the learnings from this issue to create a GitHub issue on the connected repository and assign it to GitHub Copilot.
```

## Chat 3 — App Dependencies

```prompt
Generate a diagram for the application dependencies of the frontend from the backend APIs. Analyze Application Insights dependency telemetry of the last 24h to infer the backend APIs if required. The output should be a pretty visual ASCII diagram.

Generate a Mermaid diagram with number of calls and average response time.

Summarize this in a table.
```

## Chat 4 — Madrid API (Windows Logs — Event Viewer)

```prompt
Check Madrid API response status codes, errors and response time in the last 24h.

Can you format the results in a more visual table?

Get me a summary table of the calls per operation.
```

## Chat 5 — Paris API (Linux Logs — Syslog)

```prompt
Check Paris API response status codes, errors and response time in the last 24h.

Format the output results in a table.

Also check external dependencies status of Paris API in the last 24h and summarize the results in a table.
```

## Chat 6 — 3rd-party API — Berlin Park API assessment via MCP

```prompt
Please assess the Berlin Park API right now. Check health, latency, throughput, error rate, and availability for the last 60 minutes. Use SLO thresholds: p95 < 100 ms, error rate < 1%, availability ≥ 99.9%. Summarize results in one table with columns: Category | Metric | Value | Threshold | Status. Then add: 1) a 2–3 sentence summary, 2) key evidence with timestamps, 3) likely causes/hypotheses, 4) recommended actions, 5) follow-ups/requests. If SLOs are failing, clearly call it out. If any data is unavailable, state the gaps. Include the latest parking occupancy snapshot if available.
```

> **Tip**: Prompt quality matters. Azure SRE is backed by an LLM and benefits from precise, structured prompts.

```prompt
You are an observability assistant. Assess the Berlin Park API for the last 60 minutes.

Inputs:

SLOs: p95 latency < 100 ms; error rate < 1%; availability ≥ 99.9%
Metrics to compute/report: health, p95 latency (ms), throughput (requests/min and total), error rate (%), availability (%)
Also include: latest parking occupancy snapshot (total, available, occupied, % occupied, per-level if present)
Output format (strict):

First render a GitHub-flavored Markdown table with EXACT columns: | Category | Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
Populate rows for Health, Latency (p95), Throughput, Error Rate, Availability.
Status must be one of: PASS, FAIL, INFO.
Use ISO8601 UTC timestamps where relevant in Value.
If a metric is unavailable, use N/A and explain in Data gaps later.
Do not include any text before the table.
Then add these sections in order:
Summary (2–3 sentences, concise, call out SLO breaches clearly if any)
Key evidence (bulleted list with timestamps and concrete values)
Likely causes/hypotheses (bulleted, 2–4 items)
Recommended actions (bulleted, prioritized, concrete)
Follow-ups/requests (bulleted)
Data gaps (bulleted; list any unavailable data)
Rules:

If any SLO is failing, add a single line "SLOs FAILING" immediately after the table.
No emojis. Keep numbers to 2 decimal places where applicable.
Use UTC timestamps (ISO8601).
Throughput row should show both rpm and total (e.g., "5 rpm (total 1,887)").
Example table header (use this exact header): | Category | Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
```
